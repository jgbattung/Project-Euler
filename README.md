# Project Euler Solutions

![Project Euler Logo](https://projecteuler.net/themes/logo_default.png)

This repository contains my solutions to various problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. These problems are a great way to improve your problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and programming abilities.

## About Project Euler

Project Euler offers a wide range of problems that cover various mathematical and computational concepts. Each problem comes with a clear statement and requires you to find an efficient solution to it. The problems start simple and gradually increase in complexity, making it a perfect platform to learn and grow as a programmer and mathematician.

## Repository Structure

- All solution files are located in the "problems" directory.
- Each solution file is named after the problem it solves, e.g., `multiplesOfThree.js`.
- Inside each solution file, you will find comments explaining the problem and the approach used to solve it.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Browse the "problems" directory to find solutions to specific problems.
2. Open a solution file to view the code and read the comments for an explanation of the problem and the approach taken.
3. You can learn from the solutions and explanations to improve your problem-solving skills.
4. Feel free to contribute your own solutions or improvements to existing ones.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have a different or more optimized solution for a problem or if you notice any issues with the existing solutions, please open a pull request. Please make sure to add clear and informative comments to your code.

## Disclaimer

Please remember that Project Euler encourages independent problem-solving. While this repository provides solutions, it's recommended to attempt the problems on your own first before referring to the solutions.

Happy coding and happy problem-solving!
